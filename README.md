# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to visually show the magnitude of earthquakes all over the world.

## Task
For this challenge, I was tasked to show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, along with  all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. I made three different layers: street, satellite, and dark with reference selections to Earthquakes, Major Earthquakes, and Tectonic Plates.

## Approach
The approach was to use the JavaScript and the D3.js library to retrieve the coordinates and magnitudes of the earthquakes from the GeoJSON data.
